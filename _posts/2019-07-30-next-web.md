There are several problems that we are facing today with the internet. Big
companies like Facebook and Google hold a lot of data about us, and they are
able to manipulate it without anyone noticing. Today we use a couple of web
services to represent our digital identity: email addresses, a facebook account,
a linked in account, instagram account, and so on. The problem with this is
that: 1; a lot of data leaks out about us since we are connecting a lot of services
to central ones, 2; once data has leaked it is difficult to start a new page; the
services already know your personal email, they can bombard you with spam
emails, sell your email address and sell your data to third parties while you are
still behind the same identificators.

Today we want something new that respects our privacy and our desire for self-
sovereignity.

Besides this problem there are many others, such as the "abuse" of email addresses as
identifiers, and spamming. Security and corruptability of DNS is also a concern, in
my opinion. Read more about it in the pdf.
