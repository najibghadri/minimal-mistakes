About me
--------
I studied computer science in Budapest University of Technology, and will finish my Masters in 2020 summer. I specialized in different and exciting branches of today's computer science: Software Engineering, Blockchain and Web technologies, and in the last year Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Machine Learning in general.

My recent work has been focused on artifical intelligence and computer vision with my thesis, [Self-supervised Scene Understanding](https://najibghadri.com/thesis-scene-understanding/)

I made a startup initiative for a mobile social network, [Gambjo](http://gambjo.com/) with 5 other engineer friends of mine, with the goal of helping real outdoor social interactions through events and meetups, however we had to halt the idea, as apparently it's not our time. But we still believe in it!

I envision the [Next Web](https://najibghadri.com/next-web/), the future of the World Wide Web, where you have decentralization of central authorities (like DNS and CAs) and validity, security of information and digital identity through distributed ladder technologies, and linked-data and interoperability of web, mobile and desktop applications. This, implemented on a new platform that acts as both an operating system and a web/mobile/desktop application platform, could drastically improve productivity over our legacy systems of Linux which I favor for compatibility and open-source cooperation and Windows which is sucessful in applications for basically all sectors in business, and probably be useful in IoT too.

However any company could initiate this direction, maybe even a Gambjo :)..
