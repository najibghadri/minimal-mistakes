About me
--------
Check out my latest work the Face-time Gaming website [QuaranTime.io](https://quarantime.io/) and have some fun with your friends! ðŸ˜€ðŸ¥³
I participated in the Junction Hackhaton 2020 with my friends, and we made the conept app, [SpendWise](https://spendwise-c6b5b.web.app/), that helps you understand your financial habits and tendencies, ultimately helping you save money.


I studied computer science in Budapest University of Technology, and finished my Masters in 2020. I specialized in different and exciting branches of today's computer science: Software Engineering, Blockchain and Web technologies, and in the last year Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Machine Learning in general.

My recent work has been focused on artifical intelligence and computer vision with my thesis, [Driving Scene Understanding with Stereo Imaging and Deep CNN synergy
](https://najibghadri.com/msc-thesis/)

I made a startup initiative for a mobile social network, [Gambjo](http://gambjo.com/) with some engineer friends of mine, with the goal of helping real outdoor social interactions through events and meetups, however we had to halt the idea, as apparently it's not our time. But we still believe in it!

I envision the [Next Web](https://najibghadri.com/next-web/), the future of the World Wide Web, where you have decentralization of central authorities (like DNS and CAs) and validity, security of information and digital identity through distributed ladder technologies, linked-data and interoperability of web/mobile/desktop applications. These, implemented on a new platform, that acts as both an operating system and a platform of web/mobile/desktop applications, could drastically improve productivity of both developers and consumers over our legacy systems of Linux and Windows, first of which I favor for compatibility and open-sourceness, and the latter which is sucessful in applications for basically all business sectors. Further more this system could be useful for IoT applications even, if done right.

Any company could initiate this direction, maybe even a new one.
